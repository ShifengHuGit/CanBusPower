<h1>About Luminary Micro</h1>
<p>
Luminary Micro, Inc. designs, markets and sells award-winning ARM&reg;
Cortex&trade;-M3-based microcontrollers (MCUs).  Luminary Micro is the lead

Luminary Micro's introduction of the Stellaris&reg; family of products provides
32-bit performance for the same price as current 8- and 16-bit microcontroller
designs.  With entry-level pricing at $1.00 for an ARM technology-based MCU,
Luminary Micro's Stellaris product line allows for standardization that
eliminates future architectural upgrades or software tools changes.
