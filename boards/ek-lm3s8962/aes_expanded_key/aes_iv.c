//! Generate an IV (initialization vector) for AES use.
//!
//! \param ucIV is where the generated initialization vector is stored.
//! \param bNewTime determines if the SysTick timer is read or if the previous
//! time value is used.
//!
//! This will generate a new unique IV for AES use. It may be set to
//! inject the Systick (timer) time value each time or only once.
//!
//! \note  There are 4 easy methods to handle the Initialization Vector (IV)
//! to be shared by two or more devices:
//! 1. You build up one from one side and send to the other side using
//!    no encryption or ECB encryption. The other side may validate
//!    the IV (e.g. matches a CRC code or something). Then, the new
//!    IV is sent in each encrypted message or in certain messages (such
//!    as requests).
//! 2. You send part of the IV to the other side and pre-agree to the
//!    rest as an application unique value. Again, the follow on IVs are
//!    normally sent in following messages.
//! 3. Using time. After an initial message, a time base is agreed.
//!    Then, each following IV represents the time since that base.
//!    Either the next IV is sent in messages (and so validated by
//!    being within a short time range) or the time is rounded up to
//!    units such as seconds, so that the reciever can guess the IV
//!    (current seconds count or previous seconds count).
//! 4. A message counter is used so that each side knows what the
//!    next IV will be (and replay attacks will fail). This only
//!    works with reliable communications.
//!
//! \return None.
