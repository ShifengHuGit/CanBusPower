Ethernet with uIP

This example application demonstrates the operation of the Stellaris
Ethernet controller using the uIP TCP/IP Stack.  DHCP is used to obtain
an Ethernet address.  A basic web site is served over the Ethernet port.
The web site displays a few lines of text, and a counter that increments
each time the page is sent.
